# Review of CSS

## What went well

- Able to change box colors
- Added a link at the bottom of the page to take you back to the top.  Added style.
- Went more sepcific on margin

```css
li {
    margin: auto;
    margin: 5px 10px;
    margin: 1px 5px 8px 10px;
    margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px
}
```

- Linking index.html to css
- The options that VS Code gives you.

## What did not go so well

- Had some issues with linking initially
- Trying to position pictures

```html
<h1 id="left" class="center">This is an H1</h1>
<h2 class="center" class="right" >This is an H2</h2>
```

```css
#left {

}
.center {

}
```
